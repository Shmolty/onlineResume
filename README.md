# Colton Gurr Online Resume & Portfolio

## Summary
This website will serve as my personal online portfolio and I will continue to update it as my experience and history expands. It's in a good state for viewing right now, but there's still a lot more I would like to tweak and add (such as a functioning back-end).

You can view the website [here!](https://shmolty.github.io/onlineResume/)

## Languages and Libraries
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap CSS
* JavaScript

## Notes / Improvements to Make
* ~~Improve the sizing of images on the projects.html page~~
* ~~Add live form validation with JS~~
* Create a splash/home page for the site
* ~~GitHub pages does not set up index.html correctly on it's own. Clicking resume in the nav crashes the site (404).~~
* ~~Images do not show up on GitHub Pages~~
* Improve or redo the projects.html layout
