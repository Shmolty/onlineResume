              <p class="card-text">This is one of many examples of hardware projects I did at Davis Technical College. The objective of this one was to replace a Laptop Hard Drive as well as the SODIMM. I swapped out both parts and booted the laptop to ensure functionality. Then swapped the parts back to reset the project.</p>

This is something I have done many times over since the age of 14. Every PC I have owned has been custom built by myself, and I've helped many friends and family members build their own as well.</p>

              <p class="card-text">I found this to be one of the coolest projects that I have done. I had to configure the BIOS settings to boot using PXE, and then connect the computer to the network so that it can reach the server providing PXE boot. From there it was following typical Windows installation steps.</p>
              <p class="card-text"><small class="text-body-secondary">I also set up installations via ISO file on a USB drive for both Windows and Linux</small></p>
